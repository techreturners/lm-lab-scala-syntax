  // Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple
  // arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.
  // Its very common to curry functions in other languages such as JavaScript.
  // It is made possible by being able to assign functions to variables.
  //
  // Although the following guide is JavaScript it provides a good description
  // around some sample use cases of currying
